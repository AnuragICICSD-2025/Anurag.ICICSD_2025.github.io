				<h3>Conference Scope</h3>
				<p>
					 The ICICSD 2025 focuses primarily on emerging trends in intelligent computing for sustainable development. The conference will showcase the state-of-the-art research in intelligent computing through pre-conference workshops, keynote addresses, demonstrations, technical sessions, and special sessions. High-quality submissions are expected, given its broad scope encompassing the latest technology trends and promising research areas such as digital healthcare, renewable energy, smart cities, digital farming, and autonomous systems. All accepted papers will be considered for publication in the Springer book series. Additionally, extended versions of selected papers will be reviewed for potential publication in special issues of WoS/Scopus indexed journals. This conference series serves as a pivotal forum for sharing novel ideas and research efforts among researchers, academicians, and professionals in the fields of intelligent computing and related areas. By organizing this series of conferences, we aim to foster research and benefit society through significant advancements in these domains. The vision of ICICSD 2025 is to promote research and facilitate knowledge sharing among academicians, scientists, researchers, and industry personnel, thereby exploring future research avenues that contribute to societal welfare.
